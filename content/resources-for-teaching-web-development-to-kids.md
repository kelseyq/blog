I’m helping put together a web development workshop & longer class
targeted at girls ages 7 to 16 for [Black Girls
Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/) this summer. If you’re in the Bay
Area, [we need
volunteers](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/volunteer-signup.html) for our
June 30th workshop. There’ll be a training before the workshop so no
worries if your coding skills are rusty/non-existent–if you’re willing,
we want your help!

Here’s some resources I’ve found for teaching web development to kids:

- [Hackasaurus](http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/educators/)
<br/>From Mozilla, a Firebug-like tool aimed at kids that allows them to edit websites on the fly. Designed as a web dev teaching tool, for “hack jams” of one day or longer. Resources include several slide decks and lesson plans.<br/><br/>
- [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/)
<br/>Lesson plans & activities that teach core CS concepts without using computers. Good resource for teaching more theoretical stuff in an engaging way/appealing to different kinds of learners. [Text Compression](http://csunplugged.org/text-compression), [Image Representation](http://csunplugged.org/), and [Human Interface Design](http://csunplugged.org/human-interface-design) would all be relevant to a web development class.<br/><br/>
- [How the Internet Works](http://cse4k12.org/internet/how-internet-works.html)
<br/>A cool lesson plan about the actual systems that underlie the internet–stuff most adults working in the field don’t even know!<br/><br/>
- [W3C Education Wiki](http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page)
<br/>Almost information overload. Detailed curriculums, lesson plans, assignments, and evaluation rubrics for teaching web development. Probably a little advanced for the targeted age group.<br/><br/>
- [Tizag tutorials](http://www.tizag.com/)
<br/>Not aimed specifically at kids, but clearly written tutorials using simple language covering HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more.<br/><br/>
- [Web Design & Development course](http://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/)
<br/>Project-based curriculum for high schools, developed by the University of Washington. Free but registration required. Last updated in 2009.<br/><br/>
- [Intro To Website Design & Development](http://www.mentormob.com/learn/playlists/intro-to-website-design-development)
<br/>MentorMob playlist of videos & articles created by Kim Wilkens for use in workshops for middle schoolers.
