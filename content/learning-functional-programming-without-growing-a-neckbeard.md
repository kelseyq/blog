I gave a beginning functional programming talk called [Learning Functional Programming without Growing a
Neckbeard](https://marakana.com/s/post/1354/learning_functional_programming_scala_video)
for the [SF Scala](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Scala/) meetup on December 13th. The slides are below and you can watch a [video of the talk](https://marakana.com/s/post/1354/learning_functional_programming_scala_video)
on Marakana’s website.

You can also [view the JS version](http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/talks/fptalk), including my notes. The notes are in the super-secret presenter view which you enter by clicking within the slides and hitting the “s” key on your keyboard.

If this presentation piqued your interest in Scala and functional programming, you may find this post of [resources for getting started with Scala](http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/blog/2013/01/07/resources-for-getting-started-with-functional-programming-and-scala/) useful.
