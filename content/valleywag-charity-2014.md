So, Nu Valleywag is basically over, but the outrage reads (and [actual investigative tech journalism](http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-and-its-shady-partners-are-pushing-drivers-into-su-1649936785)) were fun while they lasted, no? Last year, I compiled a list of Bay Area nonprofits themed by recent Valleywag posts and I thought I'd send off our favorite Silicon Valley gossip rag with a sequel. Close out this spectacularly shitty 2014 with a rage gift dedicated to your least favorite tech story!

[Confirmed: Snapchat Turned Down More Than $3 Billion Last Year](http://valleywag.gawker.com/confirmed-snapchat-turned-down-more-than-3-billion-la-1671970191): This was, almost certainly, a Bad Business Decision. Thankfully, there are organizations you can contribute to who are helping much more worthy folks make better decisions. The **[Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center](http://www.rencenter.org/)** provides training, mentorship and financing assistance to very low- to moderate-income Bay Area residents starting their own businesses, with a special focus on women, people of color, and formerly-incarcerated individuals. **[AnewAmerica](http://www.anewamerica.org/)** offers similar services to immigrant and refugee communities. Maybe you're less concerned by Snapchat and its fratty founders in particular and more horrified at the bigger picture of where these funny-money numbers are coming from and going to? Consider donating to Oakland's **[Democracy at Work Institute](http://institute.usworker.coop/)** to support the cause of worker-owned cooperatives in the U.S., or the **[Sustainable Economies Law Center](http://www.theselc.org/)** working to strengthen the legal basis of community resilience and local economic empowerment.
    	
[Zillow Accused of Subjecting Female Employees to "Sexual Torture"](http://valleywag.gawker.com/zillow-accused-of-subjecting-female-employees-to-sexua-1665833391) and [Suit: Zillow Says Women Over 40 Are "Too Old to Close," "Can't Keep Up"](http://valleywag.gawker.com/suit-zillow-says-women-over-40-are-too-old-to-close-1667009916): These lawsuits paint a picture of a straight-up horrific working environment for women at Zillow. It's thanks to **[Equal Rights Advocates](http://www.equalrights.org/)**' 40 years of work protecting the economic and educational rights of women, girls and working families that this kind of mistreatment is even illegal. Sadly, it's clear there's still a ton of work for the civil rights organization to tackle.

[These Letters Reveal Which Congressmen Google Has In Its Pocket](http://valleywag.gawker.com/these-letters-reveal-which-congressmen-google-has-in-it-1663875664): Honestly, this one scares me. I don't know what to do about the rapidly growing influence of money in our political system. One of the few things that gives me hope is seeing successful community organizing make tangible political changes. **[Coleman Advocates for Children and Youth](http://colemanadvocates.org/)** has been giving working class youth and parents of color in San Francisco the tools and support to organize and lead political action for over 35 years. (Hat tip to [@ReninaWrites](https://twitter.com/ReninaWrites) for this selection.)

[Blue Bottle, Which Raised $45 M, Cut Health Benefits for Part-Timers](http://valleywag.gawker.com/blue-bottle-which-raised-45-m-cut-health-benefits-fo-1663442765): Part-time workers comprise an increasingly large portion of the employed in this country yet enjoy almost no workplace protections. Just this month, though, San Francisco adopted a groundbreaking [Retail Workers' Bill of Rights](http://www.jwj.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-san-franciscos-retail-workers-bill-of-rights) that bans abusive scheduling practices commonly applied to part-time workers. That bill and others, including the new $15 minimum wage, was championed by **[Jobs With Justice SF](http://jwjsf.org/)**, a coalition of local labor & community groups.

The [picks from last year](http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/blog/2013/12/12/throw-some-gouda-at-that-whine-valleywag-post-plus-bay-area-charity-pairings/) are, of course, just as worthy today and I encourage you to check them out if you haven't already. No repeats in this one but my mother told me I'd be in deep trouble if I didn't plug her excellent organization **[TNDC](http://www.tndc.org/)** again--so hi, mom!
