Title: Enjoy Yourself Because You Can't Change Anything Anyway: Immutable Data in the Real World
Date: 2015-05-26 08:53

Immutable values are great for dealing with concurrency safely. What else, though, can we gain from programming with immutable data? In this talk from Codemania 2015, I explore the benefits and practical applications of immutable data beyond concurrency in both object-oriented and functional programming, from individual immutable fields up to system-level immutability.

I experimented with posting the slides as tweets, to go with the <a href="http://www.autostraddle.com/artist-attack-jenny-holzer-cant-protect-you-anymore-133945/">Truisms</a> theme. All art by Jenny Holzer, except for the function machine image which is by Duane Q. Nykamp and is delightful.
